# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** materials, along with solutions to a variety of problems.

It includes:
- 📚 Core concepts and implementations of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- ⚙️ Algorithms including sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and more
- 🧠 Problem-solving approaches and techniques

This repo serves as both a study resource and a personal practice archive.  
I continue to update it as I explore more advanced topics and solve new problems.
